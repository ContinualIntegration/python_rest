Here are three functional tests:

#1  This shows what happens when it works:

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5050/api/v1/resources/fibonacci -d "InputValue='7'"


The Fibonacci sequence for the number you entered is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
                                                                       

#2  This shows what happens when you enter a negative number in the POST's payload:

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5050/api/v1/resources/fibonacci -d "InputValue='-1'"

Please enter an integer higher than 1.  


#3  This shows what happens when you enter a letter (or non-number) in the POST's payload:


curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5050/api/v1/resources/fibonacci -d "InputValue='12x45'"

You did not enter an integer.  Please only enter integers greater than 1.
